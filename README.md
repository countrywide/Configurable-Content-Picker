Configurable-Content-Picker
---------------------------
Creates an Umbraco Data Type similar to the Content Picker but with the added ability to specify which Document Types are available for the content editor to select from.

The Data Type renders the content tree needed to select the Content of the allowed Document Types, restricting the content editor from selecting wrong Content.
